# Nowp (or Nowpp?)
- Are you bored and stuck in your house because there's nothing different to party?
- Do you love to join your friends together to play some music, to know new people or perhaps to have a barbecue?
- Do you love uncommon things, surprises and everything that this wonderful world can show to you but you are a bit shy? 

Know **Nowp**, the best way to join people to party.

## How it works?
1. Register on Nowp
2. You have 2 ways to show up into a party
  1. You can join an ongoing Event or...
  2. You can create yours
  
### Creating an Event
Shortly: You create an event, like a Facebook event, except by one thing: 

**You can only create events this day (Today! NOW!)!**

Of course, you could need some help, so you can ask event guests to help you bringing some items like:
Speaker, DJ equipment, Grill, Meat, Beers, Vodka and whatever you think you'll need to make an unforgettable party!

##### The place
Afraid of people blowing up your house? Nevermind... You can set the place you want, even a public square.

Moreover, you can **make some money** charging the event! Just get the money as soon as the guest are showing up in your 
event. And you don't need to pay for that.

Finally, you can also tell what kind of music will play at the event. So...
Everybody can enjoy together in the same odd-party.

### Joining an event
Seek on the **map** where are happening some events and join up!
You can also join as invisible, then nobody can track you over the night (or day).

#### Searching and Following events
You can search for ongoing events and follow them in real time. You can also:
- See guests joining to and event
- See guests coming to event (through the map, of course)
- Follow event's photos and videos though event's **#hashtag** on Instagram or Facebook
